# Drugs

To create a new drug, roll 6d20 to discover its color, form, ingestion method, effect, and addiction die. (Roll twice for effect).

Each time you take a drug, roll the addiction die.

If you roll a 1 or a 2, you suffer some negative effect (in addition to the drug's positive ones).

If you roll a 1, the die steps down one size category. (e.g. d20 -> d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4). When you roll 1 on a d4, you are addicted.

If you are addicted to a drug, your addiction die permanently becomes d4, and you must ingest the drug at least once each week. Otherwise, you roll at disadvantage.
