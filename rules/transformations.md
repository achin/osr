# Transformations

Powerful magic spells, curses, artifacts can transform your body, mind, or soul into another being. When your transformation begins, you gain a **Transformation Die**. This is a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, or d4, depending on the power of the transformation. (Smaller dice are more powerful.)

Each morning, roll your Transformation Die. If you roll a 1, your transformation progresses.

* You gain an additional trait, corresponding to your new form (e.g. you sprout horns, you grow gills, you crave flesh).
* This trait has both benefits and drawbacks. You define one, and the Warden defines the other.
* Your transformation die steps down to the next smallest size.

If your Transformation Die is a d4 and you roll a 1, then your transformation is complete. This may or may not be reversible.
